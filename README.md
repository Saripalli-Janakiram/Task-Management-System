# Task-Management-System
TaskManagementSystem V1.0.0
Project Statement: Task Management System
Objective:
Develop a Task Management System that allows users to create, track, and manage tasks efficiently. The system should provide user authentication, task categorization, and the ability to assign tasks to team members. The backend will handle data storage and authentication, while the front end will provide a user-friendly interface for interaction.
Key Features:
1.	User Authentication:
o	Implement user sign-up, login, and logout functionalities.
o	Use JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for session management and security.
2.	Task Management:
o	Users should be able to create, edit, delete, and view tasks.
o	Tasks should include a title, description, due date, priority (low, medium, high), and status (pending, in-progress, completed).
o	Users can categorize tasks into projects or groups.
3.	Team Collaboration:
o	Allow users to assign tasks to other registered users in the system.
o	Notifications to users when tasks are assigned or updated.
4.	Task Filters & Search:
o	Implement search functionality to filter tasks based on status, priority, or user assignment.
o	Enable sorting tasks by due date, priority, or creation date.
5.	Analytics Dashboard:
o	A dashboard that provides an overview of tasks, such as tasks completed, pending tasks, and tasks by priority.
o	Visual representations of data (e.g., bar charts, pie charts).
6.	Responsive Design:
o	Ensure that the application is fully responsive and can be accessed on both desktop and mobile devices.
7.	Admin Panel (Optional):
o	Create an admin interface where administrators can manage users, assign roles, and view all tasks in the system.

Technology Stack:
Frontend:
•	Angular: Framework for building the front end.
•	HTML/CSS: For designing the user interface.
•	Bootstrap/Tailwind CSS: For responsive and modern styling.
•	Angular Router: To handle client-side routing.
•	NGRX/NgRx Store (Optional): To manage application state for complex task interactions.
•	Reactive Forms/Template-driven Forms: For user input handling and task creation.
Backend:
•	Node.js with Express.js: To create RESTful APIs that serve data to the front end.
•	MongoDB/MySQL/PostgreSQL: For database storage of tasks, users, and relationships between them.
•	JWT: For user authentication and authorization.
Testing:
•	Jasmine & Karma: To test Angular components, services, and logic.
•	Protractor (Optional): For end-to-end testing of the entire application.

Functional Requirements:
1.	User Authentication Module:
o	Users must register and log in with a username and password.
o	Passwords should be encrypted before storing them in the database.
o	Users should be authenticated via JWT after login.
2.	Task Management Module:
o	Users can create tasks with a title, description, due date, priority, and status.
o	Users can assign tasks to other users within the system.
o	Tasks can be edited or deleted only by the task creator or assigned user.
3.	Dashboard and Analytics:
o	The dashboard should show a summary of tasks grouped by status and priority.
o	It should include task statistics for the user, such as completion rate.
4.	Search and Filtering:
o	Users can search for tasks by keyword, filter them by status or priority, and sort them by due date.

Non-Functional Requirements:
1.	Security:
o	Implement proper security measures to protect user data.
o	Ensure secure handling of authentication tokens.
o	Data validation and sanitization should be enforced.
2.	Performance:
o	Optimize both the client-side and server-side for faster load times and efficient task handling.
o	Ensure scalability for handling multiple users concurrently.
3.	Usability:
o	Ensure the interface is intuitive and easy to navigate, with clear buttons for actions.
o	Provide real-time updates where applicable (e.g., task status change notifications).

Project Phases:
1.	Phase 1 - User Authentication & Basic Task Management:
o	Implement user sign-up, login, and logout features.
o	Create basic task creation, editing, and deletion functionality.
2.	Phase 2 - Task Assignment & Filters:
o	Add functionality to assign tasks to other users.
o	Implement search, filtering, and sorting functionalities.
3.	Phase 3 - Analytics Dashboard & Admin Panel:
o	Build a dashboard to display task statistics.
o	Create an admin panel for managing users and tasks (optional).
4.	Phase 4 - Testing and Deployment:
o	Write unit and integration tests using Jasmine & Karma.
o	Perform end-to-end testing with Protractor.
o	Deploy the application on a cloud platform like AWS or Heroku.
